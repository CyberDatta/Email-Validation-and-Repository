Ez MAIL

Arihant is a B2B sales representative for a growing startup. He wants to contact another business, which may be a suitable customer for his company’s product. Unfortunately, the contact information of the higher level manager he wishes to reach out to is not publicly available. Also he wants to contact multiple employees of the other business, in order to reach as many leads as possible. 

He makes a list of the publicly available contacts that he scrounges from multiple websites and online sources. Also using the domain name and some deduction, he guesses a few possible mail-ids for the individuals he wishes to contact. These deduced contacts may not be valid at all, as they are mostly derived from strained guesswork. 

The effort to search for these contacts occupies a large amount of Arihant’s time, time which can be whittled away to essentially nothing with the help of our software solution.

All Arihant needs to do is enter the domain name of the mail server of the business he wishes to contact into our application and press enter. Via a web crawling as well as an email validation functionality, our software returns a list of email ids pertaining to the target company.

Arihant can simply use these email ids confident that they are valid, knowing he has saved hours worth of effort.
